# Pirate-Treasure-Hunting-Game
AI based pirate treasure-hunting game 
<br/> 

For this repo, I am sharing the code and design defense document I developed as I created an AI based game that meet the following specifications: 


You are working as an AI developer for a gaming company. The company is developing a treasure hunt game where the player needs to find the treasure before the pirates find it. As an AI developer, you have been asked to design an intelligent agent of the game for an NPC (non-player character) to represent the pirate. The pirate will need to navigate the game world, which consists of different pathways and obstacles, in order to find the treasure. The pirate agentâ€™s goal is to find the treasure before the human player. This is commonly called a pathfinding problem, as the agent you create will need to find a path towards its goal.

You have been provided with some starter code and a sample environment where your pirate agent will be placed. You will need to create a deep Q-learning algorithm to train your pirate agent. Finally, you have also been asked to write a design defense that demonstrates your understanding of the fundamental AI concepts involved in creating and training your intelligent agent.
